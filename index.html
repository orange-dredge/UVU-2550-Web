I declare that the following source code was written by me, or provided
by the instructor for this project. I understand that copying source
code from any other source, providing source code to another student, 
or leaving my code on a public web site constitutes cheating.
I acknowledge that  If I am found in violation of this policy this may result
in a zero grade, a permanent record on file and possibly immediate failure of the class.



Reflection: I have some mild experience with web development so this website was not very hard to build. It was just relearning how to do some of the stuff.

		<h2>A Haiku I Wrote</h2>
		<p>I spend may of my night studing at a bed by a window sill. It is a place of peace and comfort to me. Much of my time can seem to fade away on a rainy night</p>

		<h2>Personal Interest</h2>
		<div class="hobbies">
			<p>I have a love for video games. even at a young age. It has continued on to the modern day. I love all kinds but have a particular love for rouge likes and platformers. My love of video games impacted my decision to go into computer science</p>
			<p>I have a love for music. I got a lot of my current taste from my older siblings so I have ended up listening to a lot of alternative music. The first band I got into was an at the time up-and-coming band called Twenty-one Pilots. I continue my love for music today with many other bands </p>
			<p>I also have a love for coding a problem solving. I am happy a field like this exists as it is something I enjoy doing. I have a little bit of practice coding games for fun which has honestly helped.
